# CalculatorGUI
I have previously made calculator GUI using python, but decided it was time for a proper attempt at it with full functionality.

In the past I used TKinter to produce the UI, but in this project I used PyQT6 to expand my knowledge of Python.

I'm hoping to add more functionality and aesthetic improvements in the future.

Enjoy!
